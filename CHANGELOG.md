# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.5] - 2025-08-31

### Enhanced
- **Articles**: Added optional markdown content conversion for `Get` and `Get Many` operations with a user-controlled boolean toggle (default: off). When enabled, returns both original HTML content and a new `markdown_content` field, perfect for AI tooling workflows.

### Fixed
- **All Resources**: Fixed `Get` operation response unwrapping issue across all 20+ resources (Articles, Companies, Assets, Procedures, Websites, Users, Networks, Folders, Groups, Asset Passwords, Asset Layouts, Password Folders, Procedure Tasks, Rack Storages, Rack Storage Items, VLANs, VLAN Zones, Lists, List Options, Asset Layout Fields) where individual item responses were wrapped in resource-specific containers (e.g., `{ articles: [...] }`, `{ companies: [...] }`) instead of returning the data directly. Updated 32 files total including core operations and option loaders to ensure consistency with `Get Many` operations and provide uniform response handling across the entire node. Additionally fixed single-item GET operations to return the object directly instead of wrapping it in an array. 


## [1.4.4] - 2025-08-14

### Enhanced
- Added support for Password Folders and Groups from Hudu API v2.38.0
- Standardised concise operation descriptions across resources for a consistent UX
- Centralised request sanitisation to omit empty optional fields and reduce API 500s
- Adopted resource-specific update collections across all resources (e.g. `companyUpdateFields`)
- Added option loaders and integrated them in UIs:
  - Groups (for Password Folders allowed groups)
  - Networks, VLANs, VLAN Zones (used by IP Addresses, Networks, VLANs)
- Unified pagination UX (Return All/Limit) and removed manual page/page_size fields where present
- Aligned handlers to correct response wrappers and direct arrays per endpoint
- Enforced Magic Dash mutual exclusivity constraints (content vs content_link, icon vs image_url)
- Improved filter UIs (date ranges, booleans) for safer defaults

### Fixed
- Assets: Corrected AddressData custom field updates by sending snake_case field label keys and wrapping update payloads under `asset`.


## [1.4.3] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- Matchers > Get Many with Return All operation was returning only a single page (not paginating)


## [1.4.2] - 2025-06-23

### Fixed
- **Magic Dash**:
  - Corrected Creating or Updating operations by merging them into a single operation, aligning to the API
  - Fixed an issue where the `Get` operation failed to retrieve an item if it was not on the first page of results.

## [1.4.1] - 2025-06-12

### Enhanced
- **Assets**:
  - The `Get Many` operation now supports fetching assets across all companies by making the `Company ID` field optional. When the `Company ID` is omitted, a wider range of filters becomes available.
- **Asset Layouts**:
  - Aligned the `update` operation with the Hudu API, which now correctly accepts an array of field names for reordering.
- **Asset Layout Fields**:
  - The `linkable_id` field now uses a dynamic asset layout picker, improving UX for `Asset Link` and `Asset Tag` fields.

### Fixed
- **Asset Layouts**:
  - Removed the `active` field from the `create` operation, as it is only supported for updates.
  - Corrected the `update` operation to no longer show a UI for creating new fields, which was misaligned with the API's reordering functionality.
- **Asset Layout Fields**:
  - Fixed a parameter dependency loop that caused the UI to crash.
  - Refactored handler logic to use dedicated API endpoints for `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations, improving efficiency and reliability.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-06-11

### Enhanced
- The `Assets` and `Asset Layouts` resources are now fully supported for all API operations, improving functionality and resolving previous inconsistencies.

### Changed
- Reverted the separation of asset field management. Operations for standard, custom, and link fields are now handled directly within the `Asset` resource's `update` or `create` operations via the unified resource mapper, removing the dedicated `Asset Standard Field`, `Asset Custom Field`, and `Asset Link Field` resources.

### Fixed
- Corrected an issue with the Asset Layout update operation that caused a 500 Internal Server Error due to an API expectation mismatch.

## [1.3.5] - 2025-05-27

### Enhanced
- The `Lists` and `List Options` resources are now managed as separate, distinct resources, each with their own full set of CRUD operations for improved clarity and flexibility. This change allows you to manage lists themselves and the items within those lists independently.
- Management of asset fields is now performed via three new dedicated resources: `Asset Standard Field`, `Asset Custom Field`, and `Asset Link Field`. Field-level operations (get/update) are no longer handled via the main Asset resource, but through these new resources for improved clarity and modularity.
- **Public Photos resource improvements:**
  - Filter fields (`Record Type Filter` and `Record ID Filter`) are now grouped in a single optional "Filter" fixed collection for the Get Many operation, improving UI consistency and usability.
  - The Get by ID operation now fetches public photos page by page, checking each page for the requested ID and returning as soon as it is found. This is much more efficient for large datasets.
  - Documentation and type definitions for Public Photos have been updated for clarity and alignment with the API.

## [1.3.4] - 2025-05-17

### Enhanced
- Website operations now support all available fields for create and update, including new email security fields: `enable_dmarc_tracking`, `enable_dkim_tracking`, `enable_spf_tracking`, and more. This ensures complete alignment with the latest Hudu API (v2.37).

### Added
- Full CRUD support for VLAN Zones, including all fields, filters, archive status, and robust debug logging. Company picklist loader added for easier selection.
- Full CRUD support for VLANs (new in Hudu API v2.37), including all required and optional fields for create and update operations.
- List picklist loader introduced for improved usability across resources that reference lists.

### Fixed
- Asset Link Field Selector now loads correctly in update operations by pre-loading asset layout information and displaying proper layout names.

> **Note:** Some features in this version require Hudu API v2.37.0 to function properly.

## [1.3.3] - 2025-04-24

### Enhanced
- Simplified the process for creating assets specifically for use as asset links, making it more intuitive and reliable.
- The 'Return As Asset Links' feature is now available for both single asset (Get) and multiple assets (Get Many) operations, providing consistent output formatting for asset link custom fields.
- Added support for advanced properties when creating asset layout custom fields:
  - You can now set `hint`, `min`, `max`, `linkable_id`, `expiration`, `options`, `multiple_options`, `list_id`, and other advanced field data.
  - An "Other Data" input is available for all field types, allowing you to specify additional properties as required by the Hudu API (e.g., `linkable_id` for AssetLink fields, `expiration` for date fields, etc).

## [1.3.2] - 2025-04-24

### Notes
