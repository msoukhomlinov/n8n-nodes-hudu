### Added
- Added comprehensive list of activity log actions as `ACTIVITY_LOG_ACTIONS` constant

### Fixed
- Fixed activity logs resource type filter by grouping resource_id and resource_type parameters together to ensure they are used as a pair
- Fixed pagination behavior for resources that support pagination:
  - When "Return All" is enabled, properly paginates in lots of 25 records until all records are retrieved
  - When "Return All" is disabled but limit > 25, paginates in lots of 25 until reaching the limit
  - For the final batch when limit > 25, only fetches the remaining records needed
  - For limit <= 25, makes a single request with the exact limit

- Fixed magic dash pagination and returnAll functionality
- Fixed procedures "get" operation by properly handling numeric IDs and response data
- Fixed pagination and filter handling in multiple handlers (procedure_tasks, rack_storage_items, rack_storages, networks)
- Fixed response handling for rack storages and rack storage items to properly process direct array responses
- Added missing pagination parameters to rack storage items "get all" operation
- Fixed rack storage items "get all" operation by removing pagination parameters since they are not supported by the API
- Fixed users "get all" operation to correctly handle the nested "users" array in the API response
- Fixed websites "get all" operation to correctly handle the nested "websites" array in the API response
